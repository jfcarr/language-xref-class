# Language Cross-Reference class

## Requirements

You only need these if you want to work interactively with the code samples, or follow up in more detail on your own.

* [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (CS employees should already have this)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) (IDE), with the following extensions:
	* C#
	* C# XML Documentation Comments
	* Go
	* open in browser
	* Python

## Topics

I cut this down considerably from the original topic list.  Some of the areas I wanted to cover, like threading and file I/O, just don't lend themselves well to JavaScript.  I want this to be a 1-to-1 language comparison (as much as possible), so we'll explore those topics in a separate deep-dive, if anyone's interested.

Working code samples are available for each of the covered languages (C#, Python, Go, and JavaScript), for each of these topics:

* Simple Things
	* Console output
	* Functions
	* Static vs Dynamic typing
	* Variable declaration / assignment
	* String formatting / interpolation
	* Scoping
	* Loops: for and while
* Data Items
	* Arrays
	* Collections
	* Exception Handling
* Object Orientation
	* Classes / Structs
	* Constructors
	* Properties
	* Methods

## Language Highlights

### C#

Developed around 2000 as part of Microsoft's .NET initiative, it is now the flagship language for that framework.  It's available in both .NET standard (Windows-specific), and .NET Core (cross-platform).

### Python

A very popular programming language, notable for its code readability, short learning curve, [comprehensive standard library, and vast 3rd party package library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)#Libraries).

### Go

Go was developed at Google as a C/C++-like system language, but safer and easier to use.  It's especially notable for strong concurrency support, and a self-hosted compiler toolchain allowing you to easily target many architectures and operating systems.

### JavaScript

JavaScript, along with HTML and CSS, is a core technology of the World Wide Web.  As such, comprehensive support in the form of a JavaScript engine is baked in to every major web browser.  It is primarily used client-side, but JavaScript engines are implemented in many other types of host software as well, including server-side.
